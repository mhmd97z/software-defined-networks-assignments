# Software-Defined Networks Assignments

As teaching assistants of Software-defined Mobile Networks Course, we held a workshop on SDN opensource tools like Mininet, Open vSwitch, and Opendaylight controller and P4 language and related simulation tools and designed these two assignements.

## Assignment 1: Virtual Network Developments based on SDN
This assignment consists of two problems, about routing and VXLAN tunnelling in SDN environment.

## Assignment 2: P4-enabled Softwre-defined Networking
The second assignment id also comprised of two problems, about a novel load balancing technique in programmable data plane and a minimalistis simulation of an LTE mobile network.
#### To run the code, use utilities provided at [https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials).
